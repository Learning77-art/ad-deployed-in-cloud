Deploying On-Premises Active Directory in Azure

Technologies and Tools Used:

Microsoft Azure: Virtual Machines and Compute resources.
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP): Access and manage virtual machines remotely.
Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS): Directory services for authentication and management.
PowerShell: Automation and configuration scripting.

Operating Systems:

Windows Server 2022: Acts as the Domain Controller for the Active Directory environment.
Windows 10 (21H2): Used as a client machine for testing and validation.

High-Level Deployment Steps:

Azure Resource Setup: Create and configure resource groups, virtual networks, and subnets.
VM Deployment: Provision virtual machines for the Domain Controller and a client system.
Active Directory Configuration: Install and promote Active Directory Domain Services.
Domain Join and Testing: Connect the client system to the domain and validate functionality.

Deployment and Configuration Process
Detailed instructions are included for each of the following steps:

Step 1: Setting up Azure networking and resources.
Step 2: Deploying and configuring the Domain Controller.
Step 3: Promoting the server to a Domain Controller and setting up DNS.
Step 4: Testing domain functionality with a client machine.
